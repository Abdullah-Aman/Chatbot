# Chatbot
This project was implemented during the summer training period for the year 2020 at (Smart Methods) Company and the property rights are reserved for them.

# Project idea:
Building a Chatbot application for Android mobiles.

# Project description:
MIT_App_Inventor was used to build this app.

In this technical time, the chatbot is used in many platforms, websites and electronic markets, and this application was built very simply on the following Structure:

There is an application interface with a message written in it (do you need help?) and a button written on it (press to speak) and it is used to start speaking. After that, the voice message is received from the user, as follows:

1- In the case of the word (Hello) or (Hi), a random reply message will be chosen from among 3 appropriate responses options that were previously stored.
2- In the case of a sentence (How are you) or (How do you feel), a random reply message will be chosen from among 3 appropriate responses options that were previously stored.
